## 🚀 Key Responsibilties
### *FE modeling of closures*

- De-Penetrating the Closure model with appropriate thickness ratio with verifying and assigning property name and MAT values as per BOM.
- Generating connections for closures such as Bolts, Mastics, Weatherstrip, spots, Latch, Gas Strut,Bumps Stop and Wedge connections needed for analysis as per the input directions received.
- To create NAPO points with proper name & ID as per the guidelines and compare against legacy to find the differences.
- Trim mass collection and realization using Hypermesh.
- Performing signoff checks in Hypermesh and model integrity checks using SOL 103 and Optistruct run.
- Submission of reports such as Deviation documents includes Stiffness, Structural Mass Gauge, Weld, and Geometry comparison report.
- Deliver error free model along with result file and check sheet.

### *BIP Integration*

- Inputs required for the integration process are collected and report to Lead in case any missing details in the inputs.
- Receive modeling completed FE files and start integration process for the respective assembly.
- De-Penetrating the BIP model with appropriate thickness ratio with verifying and assigning property name and MAT values as per BOM.
- Create full FE model with all the necessary connections like Bolts, Adhesives, Seam, Spot & Laser Welds in BIP.
- To create NAPO points with proper name & ID as per the guidelines and compare against legacy to find the differences.
- Performing signoff checks in Hypermesh and model integrity checks using SOL 103 and Optistruct run.
- To include Supplier system assemblies into BIP and ensure the attachment location connections,
- Documentation for the build activities such as Deviation documents includes Stiffness, Structural Mass Gauge, Weld, and Geometry comparison report.
- Post Integration, models are validated against respective checklist & modal analysis and debugging process are done to verify the model.
- Deliver error free model along with result file and check sheet.

### *Acoustic Cavity*

- Working on *New SUV and Transit models* for structural and durability simulations.
- Focused on high-quality mesh generation and result interpretation using industry-leading CAE tools.
- Creating 3D seats by using cushion CAD and it is positioned to enclose the seat frame.
- NAPO’s (Ear nodes) are created based on the seat cushion profile and it will be pasted to the nodes from Air elements.
- Extracting the Wet Panel from Master TB by using Hypermesh and generating Balloon with appropriate leak length by using ANSA.
- Generating Cabin Air cavity by using the balloon, napos and 2D seats in ANSA.
- To create trunk or luggage compartment air cavity, package tray air cavity for required vehicles.
- Finalize Air cavity model in Hypermesh such as Numbering, Properties, Materials.
- Coupling Air and Seats using ANSA and Coupling Air cavity & Wetpanel using Metapost and save the required couple files.
- Perform Checks and Run the Air Cavity model – AMLS – check F06 and PCHRES.
